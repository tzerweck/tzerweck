# Hi there, I'm Tristan!
Interested in: 
- the intersection of Physics and AI
- automizing workflows end-to-end with agentic systems

Worked on: 
- applications of ML to quantum many-body problems & photonic neural networks
- using ML and Variational Monte Carlo for understanding Moire materials
- automatically structuring fragmented data with agents
- optimizing workflows that need different tools via orchestrating subagents
